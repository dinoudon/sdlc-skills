# Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement

Retrospective formats, Kaizen PDCA cycle, blameless postmortems, continuous improvement patterns.

## When to Use

Trigger when user:
- Runs sprint retrospective
- Plans continuous improvement
- Conducts blameless postmortem
- Measures team health or improvement

## Step 1: Retrospective Formats

### Start / Stop / Continue
Source: https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective

Simplest format. Three columns on board.

| Start | Stop | Continue |
|-------|------|----------|
| Things team should begin doing | Things not adding value | Things working well |
| New practices to try | Wastes to eliminate | Keep doing these |

**Good for:** new teams, first retros, quick sessions.

### 4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)

| Liked | Learned | Lacked | Longed For |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| What went well | New insights | Missing resources/skills | Things wished existed |
| What enjoyed | Key takeaways | Support gaps | Ideal state |

**Good for:** cross-functional teams, product+engineering mix.

### Mad / Sad / Glad

| Mad | Sad | Glad |
|-----|-----|------|
| Frustrations, blockers | Disappointments, missed opportunities | Wins, celebrations |
| Waste that caused anger | Things that didn't happen | Things that worked |

**Good for:** surfacing hidden frustrations, psychological safety.

### Sailboat Retrospective

Visual metaphor. Draw sailboat on board:

```
         ☀️ Sun (happiness)
          |
    ⛵ Sailboat
   /  |  \
  Wind    Rocks (risks)
 (help)   |
    \    /
     Anchor (blockers)
      |
      🏝️ Island (goal)
```

- **Wind:** propellers, things helping move forward
- **Anchor:** things slowing team down
- **Rocks:** risks, upcoming dangers
- **Island:** goal, vision
- **Sun:** things making team happy

**Good for:** creative teams, visual thinkers, big-picture thinking.

## Step 2: Running a Retrospective

### Best Practices
Source: https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective

1. **Timebox:** 60-90 min for 2-week sprint
2. **Facilitator rotates** (not always SM)
3. **Anonymous input** via sticky notes or digital tools
4. **Limit action items** to 1-3 max. Assign owners.
5. **Follow up previous retro actions** first
6. **Prime Directive:** "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand." — Norm Kerth

### Retro Agenda
```
1. Set the stage (5 min)
   - Prime Directive reading
   - Check-in question

2. Gather data (15 min)
   - What happened? Timeline, metrics, events.

3. Generate insights (15 min)
   - Why did it happen? Patterns, root causes.

4. Decide what to do (15 min)
   - 1-3 action items with owners

5. Close (5 min)
   - Appreciation round
   - Rate the retro itself
```

### Digital Tools
- **RetroTool** — https://retrotool.io/ (free, anonymous)
- **EasyRetro** — https://easyretro.io/ (popular, free tier)
- **Miro** — https://miro.com/ (general whiteboard)
- **FunRetro** — https://funretro.io/ (simple, clean)

## Step 3: Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)

Source: https://www.kaizen.com/what-is-kaizen.html

Japanese "change for better." Philosophy of ongoing incremental improvement.

### Core Principles
- Good processes bring good results
- Go see for yourself (genchi genbutsu)
- Speak with data, manage by facts
- Take action to contain and correct root causes
- Work as team
- Kaizen is everybody's business

### PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)

```
    ┌───────┐
    │ PLAN  │ Identify problem, analyze root cause,
    │       │ propose countermeasure.
    └───┬───┘
        │
    ┌───▼───┐
    │  DO   │ Implement on small scale (pilot).
    │       │
    └───┬───┘
        │
    ┌───▼───┐
    │ CHECK │ Measure results against hypothesis.
    │       │
    └───┬───┘
        │
    ┌───▼───┐
    │  ACT  │ Standardize if successful, or iterate.
    │       │
    └───────┘
```

### Kata Pattern (Mike Rother)
Source: https://miketherother.com/

1. Understand direction (challenge)
2. Grasp current condition
3. Establish next target condition
4. PDCA toward target

### In Software Context
- Sprint retros = kaizen events
- Blameless postmortems after incidents
- DORA metrics as improvement indicators
- Value stream mapping for flow optimization

## Step 4: Blameless Postmortems

### Template
```markdown
# Postmortem: [Incident Title]

## Summary
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Duration:** X hours
- **Impact:** [description of user impact]
- **Severity:** P1/P2/P3

## Timeline
| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| HH:MM | [What happened] |
| HH:MM | [Detection] |
| HH:MM | [Response] |
| HH:MM | [Resolution] |

## Root Cause
[5 Whys analysis or fishbone diagram]

## What Went Well
- [Thing that helped resolve faster]

## What Went Wrong
- [Thing that slowed resolution]

## Where We Got Lucky
- [Near-misses that could have been worse]

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| [Preventive action] | [Name] | [Date] | Open |
| [Detective action] | [Name] | [Date] | Open |
```

### Blameless Culture Rules
- Focus on systems, not individuals
- Assume everyone did their best given context
- Ask "what allowed this to happen?" not "who caused this?"
- Share learnings widely
- Track action items to completion

## Step 5: Team Health Check

### Spotify Squad Health Check
Source: https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/

| Indicator | Awesome (😊) | Crappy (😢) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Easy to release | Releasing is easy, no drama | Releasing is painful |
| Suitability | Right tools for the job | Wrong tools/frameworks |
| Tech quality | Clean code, good tests | Tech debt everywhere |
| Speed | Fast, no blockers | Slow, waiting for others |
| Mission | Clear purpose, aligned | Confused, no direction |
| Fun | Enjoy working here | Not fun |
| Learning | Growing skills | Stagnant |
| Support | Team helps each other | Everyone for themselves |
| Pawns or players | Empowered to decide | Told what to do |
| Health of codebase | Easy to change | Scary to touch |

**How to use:**
1. Each team member votes anonymously (😊/😢/meh)
2. Discuss results as team
3. Pick 1-2 areas to improve
4. Track improvement in next retro

## Pitfalls

1. **Don't skip the Prime Directive** — sets blameless tone
2. **Don't allow more than 3 action items** — focus beats breadth
3. **Don't assign actions to "the team"** — assign to named person
4. **Don't skip following up previous actions** — accountability matters
5. **Don't use same format every time** — rotate formats to stay fresh
6. **Don't skip anonymous input** — people self-censor in groups
7. **Don't run retros longer than 90 min** — fatigue kills quality
8. **Don't skip postmortems for incidents** — every P1/P2 gets one
9. **Don't blame individuals** — focus on systems and processes
10. **Don't skip data** — DORA metrics, incident counts, team health scores
