# Retrospectives & Continuous Improvement

Retrospective formats, Kaizen PDCA cycle, blameless postmortems, continuous improvement patterns.

## When to Use

Trigger when user:
- Runs sprint retrospective
- Plans continuous improvement
- Conducts blameless postmortem
- Measures team health or improvement

## Step 1: Retrospective Formats

### Start / Stop / Continue
Source: https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective

Simplest format. Three columns on board.

| Start | Stop | Continue |
|-------|------|----------|
| Things team should begin doing | Things not adding value | Things working well |
| New practices to try | Wastes to eliminate | Keep doing these |

**Good for:** new teams, first retros, quick sessions.

### 4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)

| Liked | Learned | Lacked | Longed For |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|
| What went well | New insights | Missing resources/skills | Things wished existed |
| What enjoyed | Key takeaways | Support gaps | Ideal state |

**Good for:** cross-functional teams, product+engineering mix.

### Mad / Sad / Glad

| Mad | Sad | Glad |
|-----|-----|------|
| Frustrations, blockers | Disappointments, missed opportunities | Wins, celebrations |
| Waste that caused anger | Things that didn't happen | Things that worked |

**Good for:** surfacing hidden frustrations, psychological safety.

### Sailboat Retrospective

Visual metaphor. Draw sailboat on board:

```
         ☀️ Sun (happiness)
          |
    ⛵ Sailboat
   /  |  \
  Wind    Rocks (risks)
 (help)   |
    \    /
     Anchor (blockers)
      |
      🏝️ Island (goal)
```

- **Wind:** propellers, things helping move forward
- **Anchor:** things slowing team down
- **Rocks:** risks, upcoming dangers
- **Island:** goal, vision
- **Sun:** things making team happy

**Good for:** creative teams, visual thinkers, big-picture thinking.

## Step 2: Running a Retrospective

### Best Practices
Source: https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective

1. **Timebox:** 60-90 min for 2-week sprint
2. **Facilitator rotates** (not always SM)
3. **Anonymous input** via sticky notes or digital tools
4. **Limit action items** to 1-3 max. Assign owners.
5. **Follow up previous retro actions** first
6. **Prime Directive:** "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand." — Norm Kerth

### Retro Agenda
```
1. Set the stage (5 min)
   - Prime Directive reading
   - Check-in question

2. Gather data (15 min)
   - What happened? Timeline, metrics, events.

3. Generate insights (15 min)
   - Why did it happen? Patterns, root causes.

4. Decide what to do (15 min)
   - 1-3 action items with owners

5. Close (5 min)
   - Appreciation round
   - Rate the retro itself
```

### Digital Tools
- **RetroTool** — https://retrotool.io/ (free, anonymous)
- **EasyRetro** — https://easyretro.io/ (popular, free tier)
- **Miro** — https://miro.com/ (general whiteboard)
- **FunRetro** — https://funretro.io/ (simple, clean)

## Step 3: Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)

Source: https://www.kaizen.com/what-is-kaizen.html

Japanese "change for better." Philosophy of ongoing incremental improvement.

### Core Principles
- Good processes bring good results
- Go see for yourself (genchi genbutsu)
- Speak with data, manage by facts
- Take action to contain and correct root causes
- Work as team
- Kaizen is everybody's business

### PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)

```
    ┌───────┐
    │ PLAN  │ Identify problem, analyze root cause,
    │       │ propose countermeasure.
    └───┬───┘
        │
    ┌───▼───┐
    │  DO   │ Implement on small scale (pilot).
    │       │
    └───┬───┘
        │
    ┌───▼───┐
    │ CHECK │ Measure results against hypothesis.
    │       │
    └───┬───┘
        │
    ┌───▼───┐
    │  ACT  │ Standardize if successful, or iterate.
    │       │
    └───────┘
```

### Kata Pattern (Mike Rother)
Source: https://miketherother.com/ | Book: "Toyota Kata" (Mike Rother, 2009)

Toyota Kata = structured scientific-thinking routines that make continuous improvement a daily habit, not a quarterly event.

#### Two Kata

**Improvement Kata** — systematic method for moving from current state toward target condition.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTION                               │
│     Long-term vision, challenge, or goal                   │
│     "Where are we trying to get to?"                       │

│     Map actual state: facts, data, process observation     │
│     "Where are we now? What is actually happening?"        │
│                          │                                  │

│  3. ESTABLISH NEXT TARGET CONDITION                        │
│     Next achievable step (not end state)                   │
│     Specific, measurable, just beyond current ability      │
│     "Where do we want to be next?"                         │
│                          │                                  │
